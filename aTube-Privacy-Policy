This privacy policy, reffered to as 'document' in this context, relates to the use of 'aTube', referred to as the 'App' in this context.

The document states the uses of User Data, reffered to as 'data' in this context, and any uses of restricted capabilities defined in the App.

In case an upload operation is cancelled by the operating system due to no network being available, the App can resume the upload operation when it is needed or requested otherwise without any further involvement of the user itself.
The App uses a special Windows system to access the same file again and it's recommended by Microsoft. This streamlines the process of uploading files and further advanced features can be supported. No personal data is collected from the user, even the Google email, and the data is stored on the device which can be removed when requested by the user.

The App does not collect any sort of information from users of the App and does not store any information to any remote servers unless indicated by the user.
The data in the app gets stored in the device and user can delete the data on request from within the App or can delete the App entirely from the system.

Furthermore, support is available for any issues related to the App and its use from the email id of "pakahmar@hotmail.com" or "ahmar20x@gmail.com". Feel free to contact me if you have any concerns over the data storage and use.
